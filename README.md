Crowd Server
============

This package provides a django server for running microtasks on various
crowd platforms.

The crowd server focuses on extensibility, supporting the ability to add new
task types and run them on new crowd platforms, and automatically provides
state-of-the-art quality control techniques to handle incorrect worker
responses.
